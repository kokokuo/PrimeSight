## Description
PrimeSight, also called Pal or Technology Quill, as a wearable device, aims to alert the blind with vibration and audio feedbacks when barriers appear, also with the feature of identifying similar items/products and built in 2013. With the info/message services provided, our device enhances the safety and convenience which traditional assistance tools such as white canes can provide.

The PrimeSight Software project was built by BlindAidProject and GoodsRecognitionSystems. The BlindAidProject was responsible for detecting the barrier using depth source images provided from KinectSDK depth camera and alerted by audio feedbacks and sensor vibration by Arduino.

For GoodsRecognitionSystems, focused on detecting items/products, recognizing it from RGB Images to tell blind people by audio feedbacks.
